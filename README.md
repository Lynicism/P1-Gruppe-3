# P1-Gruppe-3
Github repo for P1 CCT AAU Gruppe 3 2025

Not tested, will test in uni 12.12.2025

Still needed update to arduino file, so it masures in liters and not in cm. Python file should probably also get an update with more user-frendly functionality.  

To start, you need to first open ArduinoGetSendData.ino, then GetSaveData.c and after some use of product you can open test_get_file.py to visualize data.
