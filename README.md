# P1-Gruppe-3
Github repo for P1 CCT AAU Gruppe 3 2025

Not tested, will test in uni 12.12.2025

Still needed an update to Arduino file, so it measures in litres and not in cm. Python file should probably also get an update with more user-friendly functionality.  

To start, you need to first open ArduinoGetSendData.ino, then GetSaveData.c, and after some use of the product, you can open test_get_file.py to visualise data.
